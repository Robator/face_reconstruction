# Missing Parts Reconstruction Algorithm
There are two sets of depth images of the same size (116x120). They both represent different human faces. Images in test 
set have arbitrary distributed missing part. \
The repository contains a script that receives an image with missing data and outputs its
reconstructed representation.
